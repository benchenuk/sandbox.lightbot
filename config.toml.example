# CONFIGURATION NOTES
# =============================================================================
#
# 1. Model Configuration:
#    - Each model needs: name (model identifier), url (API base URL), key (API key)
#    - For local models (Ollama, etc.), leave key as empty string ""
#    - selected_index points to which model is currently active (0 = first)
#
# 2. Multiple Models:
#    - Add multiple [[models.list]] or [[fast_models.list]] entries
#    - Switch between models in the UI dropdown or Settings panel
#
# 3. Fast Models:
#    - Used for query rewriting when web search is enabled
#    - Should be faster/cheaper than primary models
#    - Can use the same provider as primary models or different
#
# 4. API Compatibility:
#    - LightBot uses OpenAI-compatible APIs
#    - Works with: OpenAI, Ollama, vLLM, LiteLLM, and other compatible providers
#    - URL format: https://api.example.com/v1 (must include version path)
#
# 5. Security:
#    - Keep your API keys secure and never commit them to version control
#    - For development, use project root config.toml
#    - For production, config is stored in ~/.lightbot/config.toml
